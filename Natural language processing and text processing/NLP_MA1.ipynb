    "### The following two sentences are ambiguous – that is, they each have two (or more) different readings. For each sentence, explain the different readings:\n",
    "1. The girl attacked the boy with the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be read as \"The girl used the book as a weapon to attack the boy\" or \"The girl attacked the boy who's holding a book\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We decided to leave on Saturday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be read as \"they made the decision on the saturday\" or \"the leaving is scheduled on saturday\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Are the following sentences ambiguous? If the sentence is ambiguous, explain the different readings. If not, explain why not.\n",
    "3. I saw a man with a briefcase.\n",
    "Both ambigious and not ambigious. Can be read as \"You saw a man carrying a briefcase\" or \"you used a briefcase to see a man\". The second option is grammatically correct but doesn't make any sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. I saw the planet with a telescope.\n",
    "Ambigious. Can be read as \"You used a telescope to see a planet\" or \"you saw a planet that has a telescope\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try the above sentences (3 and 4) in this parse tree generator: https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanom/syntactic_tree Compare the dependency structures for both of them. Explain the differences in the link to the preposition “with” in 3 vs. 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 3: “(I) saw a man with a briefcase.”\n",
    "- **saw** = Root (VBD)\n",
    "- **man** depends on **saw** (the direct object)\n",
    "- **with** depends on **saw** (a PP dependent/adjunct of the verb)\n",
    "- **briefcase** depends on **with** (object of the preposition)\n",
    "- **saw** → with → **briefcase**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 4: “I saw the planet with a telescope.”\n",
    "- **saw** = Root (VBD)\n",
    "- **I** depends on **saw** (subject)\n",

    "- **with** depends on **saw**\n",
    "- **telescope** depends on **with**\n",
    "\n",
    "Structurally in the outputs there’s no difference in attachment: in both, **with** attaches to the verb **saw**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretively: the same syntactic attachment has different consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In (3), verb-attachment makes the sentence lean toward the odd reading (“saw using a briefcase”), whereas many humans prefer noun-attachment (“man with a briefcase”).\n",
    "\n",
    "- In (4), verb-attachment produces the very natural instrumental reading (“saw using a telescope”), which is why the parser’s choice looks “right.”"
